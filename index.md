We are a research group in the Department of Physics & Astronomy at Texas A&M University. We are primarily interested in condensed matter theory, quantum information and quantum simulation,  with a focus on __quantum many-body physics__.

What does quantum many-body physics study? Individual fish in the school just sees their neighbors, following them based on some simple rules, while the resulting schooling behaviors are extremely rich and complex.  Quantum many-body physics studies the complex phenomena emerging from simple rule among many degrees of freedom, which instead of fish are objects that behave according to quantum mechanics, such as electrons and spins.
