# Courses

- [PHYS150 Introduction to Programming for Physics (Fall 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023)](https://github.com/slxuphys/tamu_phys_150)

    PHYS 150, a freshman physics course I developed from scratch, employs innovative teaching strategies to foster active learning. These strategies include fully open-access interactive course materials, physics simulation demos,  Python game design competitions, and collaborative group projects. The course is designed to equip physics majors with the essential programming tools for future coursework and offer them practical research experience.

- PHYS606 Quantum Mechanics I (Spring 2025)

    This graduate-level course offers a comprehensive exploration of quantum mechanics, focusing on both foundational principles and advanced problem-solving techniques. Students will develop a rigorous understanding of core concepts such as Hilbert spaces, quantum states, operators, and the postulates of quantum mechanics. The course emphasizes practical skills in solving quantum mechanical problems using Dirac notation, symmetry principles, and computational approaches. Key topics include eigenstates, time evolution, and the theory of angular momentum, including spin ladder operators and the addition of angular momenta. Students will also learn to apply approximation and numerical methods to tackle complex systems where exact solutions are unattainable. In the final part of the course, modern applications in quantum computing are introduced, covering quantum circuits, entanglement, and error correction. This course prepares students for advanced research in theoretical physics, quantum technologies, and related fields.

- [PHYS206 Newtonian Mechanics for Science and Engineering (Spring 2022)](https://mechanics.physics.tamu.edu/)

    
    Physics 206, Newtonian Mechanics for Engineering and Science, is the first semester of a two-semester sequence in introductory physics, intended to introduce students to the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics and harmonic motion. We will cover topics in mechanics, Newton's Laws, the concepts of energy and work, conservation of energy and momentum, rotational motion, gravity, harmonic motion and waves.
