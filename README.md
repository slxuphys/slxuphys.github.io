# Shenglong Xu's Research Group

Welcome to visit our group at (https://slxuphys.github.io). We are a theory group at Texas A&M University, interested in condensed matter, quantum information and quantum simulation. 

We had a lot of fun building this website using Jekyll, javascript and generative AI.
