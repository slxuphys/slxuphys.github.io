# Courses

- [PHYS150 Introduction to Programming for Physics (Fall 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023)](https://github.com/slxuphys/tamu_phys_150)

    PHYS 150, a freshman physics course I developed from scratch, employs innovative teaching strategies to foster active learning. These strategies include fully open-access interactive course materials, physics simulation demos,  Python game design competitions, and collaborative group projects. The course is designed to equip physics majors with the essential programming tools for future coursework and offer them practical research experience.

- [PHYS206 Newtonian Mechanics for Science and Engineering (Spring 2022)](https://mechanics.physics.tamu.edu/)

    
    Physics 206, Newtonian Mechanics for Engineering and Science, is the first semester of a two-semester sequence in introductory physics, intended to introduce students to the basic principles of Newtonian mechanics and harmonic motion. We will cover topics in mechanics, Newton's Laws, the concepts of energy and work, conservation of energy and momentum, rotational motion, gravity, harmonic motion and waves.
